Tracked work considered and explicitly deferred from in-flight changes. Each item carries its reasoning so a future picker-upper has the context.

## Adopt `.gstack/pregate.json` on the base branch

**What:** Add `!.gstack/pregate.json` to `.gitignore` and commit a Swift lane config to `main` (runner `swift test`, `Sources/MD2Core/**` → the test suite, `openspec/**` as an empty lane).

**Why:** `gstack-pregate` reads the base branch's config; this repo ignores all of `.gstack/`, so every `/ship` pre-gate fails `PREGATE_NO_LANE` on a Swift source change and the Swift test lane cannot be inferred. The 2026-10-19 ship ran the pre-gate with `--policy-from head` as a local workaround.

**Current state:** No config on `main`; the local `/ship` run has a working-tree config with `sh -c 'swift test' pregate {files}`.

**Pros:** The ship pre-gate works for every future branch; the test lane is explicit.
**Cons / cost:** A tiny repo config commit plus a `.gitignore` exception; review the lane mapping when test targets change. (human: ~15min / CC: ~5min)

**Depends on:** nothing.

**Start here:** copy the local config, add the `!.gstack/pregate.json` exception, and run `gstack-pregate validate` before committing.
